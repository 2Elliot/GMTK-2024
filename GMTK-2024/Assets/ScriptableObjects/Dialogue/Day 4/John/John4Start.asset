    _text: I'm so embarrassed. I left one of my books at John's place yesterday,
      and now marbles are in his house too! I'm really really hoping he doesn't mind
      I'm using this to help. Speaking of helping, Gregory asked me if I had a bat
      he could borrow, so I let him have Charlie. Could you make sure Charlie's doing
      okay for me?
