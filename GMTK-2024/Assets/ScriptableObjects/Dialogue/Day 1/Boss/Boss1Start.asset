    _text: So you're the new apprentice? Better get your stuff together quick. I
      don't have time for messing around. [TUTORIAL]

    _text: I know you're new to this town, so I'll give you the quick rundown. Here
      in this village, people value things by how heavy they are. I know it sounds
      crazy, but people here like that, so don't complain.
  - _customer: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 8d631d329c70dc2408cd93222956408d, type: 2}
    _text: Your job is to weigh the items our valued customers bring in. Over here
      you've got your counterweights which you can use to estimate the weight of
      the valued customer's item. I'll give you three to start with, but you'll have
      to buy some more from the market if you want to have any chance in succeeding.

    _text: Now you can move that scale back and forth a bit to get a better reading,
      and once you're done, make sure to put in your estimate on that printer over
      there, just press the green button when you think you're done.

    _text: Finally, customers care about accuracy and speed, so make sure you keep
      your wits with you.
  - _customer: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 8d631d329c70dc2408cd93222956408d, type: 2}
    _text: Here, I'll place a small rock on the scale. Do your best to estimate what
      it weighs.
